EasyCards - Purdue Boilermake PreHack 1st Place

EasyCards is an iOS app that virtualizes business cards to another level, allowing users to design, store and share cards all in one place. To mimic how people exchange business cards in real-life, I designed and implemented a gorgeous animation effect by letting the card fly off the sender's phone and then land down on the nearby receiver's phone seamlessly.
